This is a Next.js project for a photographer brand called Photo Nene. Use dark mode, neon green accents, 3D visuals, motion UI, gamer/futuristic aesthetic, and modern web design. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations, and react-three-fiber for 3D elements. The homepage should not display photo galleries directly. Include a dedicated Albums section, where each album opens into a dynamic, responsive masonry photo gallery.
